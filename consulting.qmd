I offer consulting services in the areas of data science and software engineering for 
projects involving Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling. I have experience working 
with a variety of clients, including startups, established companies, and academic 
researchers. My primary services include:

- **Bayesian Data Analysis**: I can help you design, implement, and deploy Bayesian models
 for your data, including hierarchical models, time series models, and spatial models. I
 can also assist with model selection, diagnostics, and interpretation of results.

- **Predictive Modeling**: I can help you develop predictive models using probabilistic
  machine learning techniques. I can also assist with feature engineering, model selection,
  evaluation, and API design.

of the project, your goals, and any relevant deadlines. If I believe I can help, I will
