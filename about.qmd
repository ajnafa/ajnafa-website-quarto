I am currently a Data Scientist and Bayesian Statistician at Game Data Pros where I design 
and build production platforms for large scale experimentation, revenue optimization, 
promotional pricing, and personalized targeting in mobile and console games. My general 
career interests center around the development and application of Bayesian inference, 
decision theory, reinforcement learning, and experimental design in industry.

::: a
I have six years' experience working both independently and in collaboration with colleagues 
to design and build production quality systems and pipelines for experimentation and ad 
campaigns, modeling complex data structures to provide insights necessary to answer questions 
and inform business decisions. My core skills include experimental design, advanced data 
analytics, process automation, R, Stan, Python, and a deep expertise in Bayesian statistics, 
decision theory, and causal inference.

In a past life, I was a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University 
of North Texas where I applied Bayesian inference and computational statistics to analyze how 
institutions shape individuals' attitudes, decisions, and behavior. I have two years of experience 
teaching undergraduate courses in statistics and causal inference for political research, American 
political institutions, and mass political behavior.
