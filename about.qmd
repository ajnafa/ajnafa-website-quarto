I am a Quantitative Social Scientist and Teaching Fellow in the Department of Political 
Science at the University of North Texas where I apply Bayesian inference and computational 
statistics to examine how contextual factors shape individuals' attitudes, decisions, and 
behavior. I have five years' experience working both independently and in collaboration 
with colleagues to model data and provide insights necessary to answer research questions. 
My core skills include research design, causal inference, quasi-experimental methods, 
advanced data analytics in R, Stan, and Python, survey research, and an expertise in 
applied Bayesian statistics. I also currently teach undergraduate courses in [applied 
causal inference for quantitative political research](https://github.com/ajnafa/psci-3300-political-science-research) 
and have previously taught courses in American political institutions and behavior.

My general career interests center around the development and application of Bayesian 
inference and predictive analytics to answer questions about complex social phenomena 
and solve business problems. As I approach the end of my PhD, I am in the process of 
transitioning from academic social science to industry data science and applied analytics 
and am actively seeking out data scientist, data analyst, and applied statistician roles, 
particularly those oriented towards consulting.
