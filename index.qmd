Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Data Scientist and Bayesian 
Statistician at [Game Data Pros](https://gamedatapros.com/core-team/) where I 
design and build production platforms for large scale experimentation, revenue 
optimization, promotional pricing, and personalized targeting in mobile and console 
games. At present, my general career interests center around the development and 
application of Bayesian inference, decision theory, reinforcement learning, and 
experimental design in industry.

More information on my background can be found on the [about](about.qmd) section
of the site and past projects from my time in academia are available on my 
[github](https://github.com/ajnafa). respectively. I also write occasional 
[blog posts](blog/index.qmd) on applied Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and data 
science. If you are interested in my consulting services, please see the 
[consulting](consulting.qmd) page.
